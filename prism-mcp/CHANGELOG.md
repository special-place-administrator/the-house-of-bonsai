# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **RotorQuant replaces TurboQuant** — Embedding compression now uses PlanarQuant (Givens 2D rotation) instead of Walsh-Hadamard Transform. 10x smaller rotation parameters (128 floats vs 16,384). Same compression ratio and accuracy guarantees.
- All `TurboQuantCompressor` references renamed to `RotorQuantCompressor`
- RFC-001 renamed from `turboquant-integration` to `rotorquant-integration`

## [9.0.0] - 2026-04-07 — Autonomous Cognitive OS

### 🧠 Affect-Tagged Memory (Valence Engine)
- **Automatic Valence Derivation** — Every memory entry gets a "gut feeling" score from -1.0 (trauma/failure) to +1.0 (success/confidence), auto-derived from `event_type` at save time. No manual classification needed.
- **Affective Salience Retrieval** — Uses absolute magnitude `|valence|` to boost retrieval salience for highly emotional memories (both positive AND negative). Prevents the Valence Retrieval Paradox where failure memories are deprioritized and agents repeat mistakes.
- **Valence Emoji Tags** — Search results display valence indicators: 🔴 (strong negative ≤-0.5), 🟠 (negative ≤-0.2), 🟡 (neutral), 🔵 (positive ≥0.2), 🟢 (strong positive ≥0.5).
- **Contextual Valence Warnings** — When top search results have historically negative affect, agents receive warnings like "⚠️ This topic is strongly correlated with historical failures."
- **Valence Propagation** — Discovered nodes in the Synapse graph inherit valence via energy-weighted averaging from source flows, with fan-dampening and strict [-1, +1] clamping.

### 💰 Token-Economic Cognitive Budget
- **Strict Token Economy** — Every memory write operation costs tokens, with cost multiplied by a surprisal-derived factor: boilerplate (2×), standard (1×), novel (0.5×). This incentivizes storing novel information over redundant entries.
- **UBI Earnings** — Budget replenishes at +100 tokens/hour passively, plus event bonuses: success (+200), learning (+100). Budget cannot exceed the initial cap (default: 2000).
- **Budget Diagnostics in Context** — `session_load_context` now shows a visual budget bar with health status (🟢 Healthy → 🔴 Critical) so agents understand their spending capacity at session start.
- **Persistent Budget** — Budget state is persisted in `session_handoffs.cognitive_budget` via lightweight `patchHandoffBudget` method, surviving across sessions.
- **Graceful Degradation** — Budget exhaustion triggers warnings but NEVER blocks writes. Zero-balance entries still save with a warning annotation.

### 🧬 Hybrid Scoring with Valence
- **Three-Component Formula** — Synapse hybrid scores now use `0.65 × similarity + 0.25 × activation + 0.10 × |valence|`, replacing the simpler `0.70 × similarity + 0.30 × activation` blend. Falls back to the legacy formula when valence is disabled.
- **computeHybridScoreWithValence()** — New pure function in `valenceEngine.ts` with configurable weights and safe clamping.

### Engineering
- All existing tests pass (zero regressions)
- All v9.0 modules are pure functions with zero I/O (valenceEngine, cognitiveBudget, surprisalGate)
- Feature-gated via `PRISM_VALENCE_ENABLED` and `PRISM_COGNITIVE_BUDGET_ENABLED` (both default `true`)
- Graceful fallback on every failure path — zero hard crashes

### Post-Review Hardening (8 fixes — architectural code review)

#### Critical
- **Valence Propagation No-Op** — `propagateValence()` was called with 2 args; signature requires 3 (`flowWeights`). Instrumented `synapseEngine.ts` to track energy `flowWeights` during propagation and wired to both storage backends.
- **Experience Events Missing Valence** — `sessionSaveExperienceHandler` never called `deriveValence()`. Experience events (`failure`, `correction`, `success`) are the primary source of typed events, yet they stored NULL valence. Now derives and passes valence to `saveLedger()`.
- **UBI "Death by 1000 Saves"** — `Math.floor()` on fractional UBI destroyed tokens on frequent saves: `floor(0.25 * 100) = 0`. Removed — `cognitive_budget` is REAL, fractional values are native. Display rounds at the format layer using `Math.round()`.

#### High
- **"Infinite Money Glitch"** — LLMs self-declaring `event_type: "success"` could mint free budget tokens. Decoupled budget bonuses from user-reported `event_type`; bonuses reserved for adversarial evaluation.
- **Surprisal Gate Disconnected** — Hardcoded `surprisal = 0.5` was the only value ever used. Wired `computeVectorSurprisal()` with early embedding generation for real-time novelty scoring; `0.5` is now a fail-safe fallback only.
- **Concurrency Race in Budget Writes** — Two agents loading the same budget, then writing absolute values, caused overwrites. Implemented delta-based updates: `COALESCE(cognitive_budget, 2000) + delta` in both SQLite and Supabase.

#### Medium
- **Missing SQLite Valence Index** — `idx_ledger_valence` was in the Supabase migration but absent from SQLite. Added `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS` in SQLite init.
- **Missing Supabase `patch_budget_delta` RPC** — Code called `supabaseRpc("patch_budget_delta")` but migration 042 never created the function. Added `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION` with `SECURITY DEFINER`.


## [8.0.3] - 2026-04-07 — Performance & Edge-Case Hardening

### Performance
- **FTS5 Trigger Scoping** — The `ledger_fts_update` trigger now fires only on `UPDATE OF project, summary, decisions, keywords`. Previously, any column update (including `last_accessed_at` bumps from ACT-R access logging) triggered a full FTS5 delete+reinsert cycle — causing 40 unnecessary disk writes per 20-result search.

### Fixed
- **Synapse Backward Flow Energy Explosion** — Backward propagation in the Synapse Engine now applies fan-dampening (`1/ln(inDegree + e)`) symmetrically with forward flow. Previously, a hub node with thousands of inbound edges would blast undampened energy to all source nodes, saturating `softCap` with irrelevant noise and violating energy conservation.
- **`json_each(NULL)` Crash Guard** — `findKeywordOverlapEntries` now wraps the `keywords` column in `COALESCE(sl.keywords, '[]')` before passing to `json_each()`. Legacy rows with `keywords = NULL` (instead of `'[]'`) previously threw a hard SQL error, aborting the entire query.

### Engineering
- 1052 tests across 48 suites, all passing, zero regressions
- Updated Synapse backward flow test to validate dampened energy calculation
- TypeScript strict mode: zero errors

## [8.0.2] - 2026-04-07 — Security & Stability Hardening

### Security
- **SQL Injection Defense-in-Depth (CRIT-1)** — Added `/^[a-z_]+$/` regex validation as a second gate on `updateAgentStatus` field name interpolation, alongside the existing allowlist. Prevents injection even if new allowlist entries are added without review.
- **LIKE Wildcard Escaping (MED-3)** — User-supplied keywords in `searchKnowledgeFallback` now escape `%` and `_` wildcards via `ESCAPE '\'` clauses. Previously, a search for `"100%_done"` matched unintended rows.
- **macOS Path Scope Escape (EDGE-2)** — `SafetyController.isPathWithinScope()` now normalizes paths to lowercase on `darwin` and `win32` platforms. Fixes case-insensitive filesystem bypass where `/App/Workspace` ≠ `/app/workspace` allowed scope escapes.
- **Tenant-Scoped Link Decay (MED-6)** — `decayLinks()` now accepts optional `userId` to scope decay to the calling user's link entries via `source_id IN (SELECT id FROM session_ledger WHERE user_id = ?)`. Prevents cross-tenant graph decay in shared-database deployments.

### Performance
- **Tier-2 TurboQuant LIMIT (HIGH-1)** — Added `LIMIT 5000` to the Tier-2 TurboQuant fallback query. Previously loaded all matching rows into JS heap for in-memory cosine scoring, risking heap exhaustion on large datasets (50K+ entries).

### Fixed
- **SDM Memory Aliasing (HIGH-2)** — `importState()` now uses `slice()` instead of `subarray()` to create independent copies of each counter row. `subarray()` creates aliased views that silently corrupt if the source buffer is GC'd or detached.
- **SDM Mode Persistence (EDGE-3)** — Added `mode` parameter to `importState()` and `getMode()` accessor. The engine's mode lock (`semantic` vs `hdc`) is now restorable on deserialization, preventing cross-talk between HDC and semantic writes.
- **HDC Dictionary Version Decoupling (EDGE-5)** — Introduced separate `HDC_DICTIONARY_VERSION` constant. `saveHdcConcept` previously used `SDM_ADDRESS_VERSION` (PRNG algorithm version), creating false coupling — a PRNG change would needlessly invalidate the concept dictionary.
- **Verification Harness File Size Guard (MED-5)** — Added `statSync()` check before reading `verification_harness.json`, capping at 1MB. Prevents heap exhaustion from malformed LLM-generated files during the Dark Factory VERIFY step.

### Interface
- `StorageBackend.decayLinks()` signature updated to accept optional `userId` (backward-compatible).
- `SparseDistributedMemory.importState()` signature updated to accept optional `mode` parameter.
- New export: `HDC_DICTIONARY_VERSION` from `sdmEngine.ts`.

### Engineering
- 1052 tests across 48 suites, all passing, zero regressions
- TypeScript strict mode: zero errors
- 6 files changed across 4 modules (storage, SDM, Dark Factory safety, Dark Factory runner)

## [8.0.1] - 2026-04-07

### Bug Fixes
- **ACT-R Sigmoid Blowout** — Changed `Si` source from unbounded `rawActivationEnergy` (could reach 15+) to normalized `activationScore` (0–1). Prevents sigmoid saturation that erased `Bi` recency/frequency from composite scores.
- **Missing `[🌐 Synapse]` Tag** — Wired `isDiscovered` boolean through storage layer (`applySynapse`) and added `[🌐 Synapse]` tag to search result formatting for discovered nodes.
- **Missing Metadata on Discovered Nodes** — Expanded `SELECT` queries in both SQLite and Supabase `applySynapse` to include `is_rollup`, `importance`, and `last_accessed_at`. Prevents ACT-R `decayRate` crash on Synapse-discovered nodes.

### Removed
- **Legacy v6.0 1-Hop Graph Expansion** — Deleted redundant N+1 graph traversal blocks from both `knowledgeSearchHandler` and `sessionSearchMemoryHandler` (−130 lines). Synapse Engine handles multi-hop at the storage layer, making these obsolete.

### Interface
- Added `isDiscovered?: boolean` to `SemanticSearchResult` interface.

## [8.0.0] - 2026-04-07

### Major Features
- **Synapse Engine (v8.0)** — Replaced the legacy SQL-coupled `spreadingActivation.ts` with a pure, storage-agnostic `synapseEngine.ts` multi-hop propagation engine.
  - Implements bounded O(T × M) ACT-R memory propagation avoiding explosive DB queries.
  - Pure functional design: zero I/O, decoupled via `LinkFetcher` callback. Paves the way for distributed graph backends.
  - Dampened fan effect (`1/ln(degree+e)`) prevents hub nodes from blindly broadcasting.
  - Asymmetric bidirectional flow (forward 100%, backward 50%) preserves causal directionality.
  - Cyclic energy tracking via `visitedEdges` set prevents recursive energy amplification.
  - Sigmoid normalization ensures structural scores don't overwhelm semantic base matches.
  - Hybrid scoring: 70% semantic similarity / 30% structural activation energy blend.

### Storage Integration
- **SQLite `applySynapse`** — Full Synapse Engine integration into `searchKnowledge` and `searchMemory`. Missing-node metadata fetched via direct SQL with per-row hydration.
- **Supabase `applySynapse`** — Full Synapse Engine integration via Supabase REST API. Missing-node metadata fetched via `supabaseGet` with `in.()` filter.
- **`getLinksForNodes`** — Implemented on both SQLite (direct SQL) and Supabase (`prism_get_links_for_nodes` RPC) backends for storage-agnostic link fetching.

### Edge Case Hardening
- **NaN Strength Guard** — `Number.isFinite()` guard on `edge.strength` prevents corrupted/null database values from poisoning the entire energy propagation map (defaults to 0).
- **Similarity Nullish Coalescing** — Fixed `similarity || 1.0` → `similarity ?? 1.0` in both backends. Previously, a valid `0.0` similarity was falsely promoted to `1.0`.
- **Config Clamping** — `lateralInhibition` and `softCap` are now clamped to minimum 1 in the engine. Setting either to 0 no longer silently drops all results.
- **Non-Fatal Enrichment** — Both backends wrap `applySynapse` in try/catch. Engine failures gracefully return original anchors instead of crashing the search operation.
- **`PRISM_SYNAPSE_SOFT_CAP` Wiring** — The env var was declared and parsed in `config.ts` but never consumed by either backend. Now correctly passed to `propagateActivation()`.

### Observability
- **`SynapseRuntimeMetrics`** — Full runtime telemetry integrated into the observability pipeline. Tracks nodes returned/discovered, edges traversed, iterations performed, max/avg activation energy, and duration.
- **Telemetry Data Fix** — Added `avgActivationEnergy` to `SynapseRunData` interface. Previously silently dropped from the engine's output during recording.

### Removed
- **Legacy `spreadingActivation.ts`** — Deleted. SQL-coupled 1-hop activation logic fully replaced by the pure Synapse engine.
- **Dead Import** — Removed deprecated `candidateScopedSpreadingActivation` import from `graphHandlers.ts`.

### Configuration
- 5 new environment variables: `PRISM_SYNAPSE_ENABLED`, `PRISM_SYNAPSE_ITERATIONS`, `PRISM_SYNAPSE_SPREAD_FACTOR`, `PRISM_SYNAPSE_LATERAL_INHIBITION`, `PRISM_SYNAPSE_SOFT_CAP`.

### Engineering
- 16 Synapse tests (5 new edge-case tests: NaN strength, lateralInhibition=0, softCap=0, linkFetcher failure, empty anchor map)
- TypeScript strict mode: zero errors
- Non-breaking: Synapse is gated behind `PRISM_SYNAPSE_ENABLED` (default: `true`)

## [7.8.8] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Ollama Embedding Adapter** — New `OllamaAdapter` (`src/utils/llm/adapters/ollama.ts`) for fully local, zero-cost text embeddings via Ollama's native `/api/embed` batch endpoint. Default model: `nomic-embed-text` (768 dims natively — zero truncation needed).
  - Batch embedding support via `/api/embed` (Ollama ≥ 0.3.0).
  - Dimension validation: hard-throws on mismatched dims, soft-truncates if model returns > 768.
  - Word-safe truncation at 8000 chars (consistent with Voyage/OpenAI adapters).
  - Configurable via dashboard: `ollama_base_url`, `ollama_model`.
- **Factory Auto-Routing for Ollama** — `embedding_provider=auto` now detects `OLLAMA_HOST` or `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` env vars as a second-priority signal (after `VOYAGE_API_KEY`). When set, auto routes to `OllamaAdapter` without explicit `embedding_provider=ollama`.

### Changed
- **LLM Factory v4.6** — Updated factory version, added `"ollama"` to the `embedding_provider` enum, updated example configurations in header docs.

## [7.8.7] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **LoCoMo-Plus Benchmark** — New cognitive benchmark suite (`tests/benchmarks/locomo-plus.ts`, 16/16 assertions) adapted from arXiv 2602.10715 (Li et al., ARR 2026). Validates Prism's ability to bridge the **cue–trigger semantic disconnect** — where causally related memories are semantically distant — using graph traversal and Hebbian consolidation. Reports real Precision@1/3/5/10 and MRR metrics across a 30-entry pool (10 cues + 20 fillers).

### Fixed
- **Benchmark Embedding Cache** — Eliminated redundant embedding computation across LoCoMo-Plus stages. Pre-computed embeddings are now cached via `Map<string, number[]>` and reused between Stage 2 (raw retrieval) and Stage 5 (metrics), cutting total embedding calls by ~60%.
- **Tautological Assertions** — Replaced `assert(true, ...)` stubs in Hebbian consolidation tests with actual storage verification (try/catch + counter), ensuring `upsertSemanticKnowledge` failures are caught rather than silently passing.
- **Dead `precisionAtK` Function** — The previous implementation created zero-vectors and called `cosineSimilarity` on them (returning NaN), with a `hits` counter that was never incremented (always returned 0). Replaced with a working implementation that filters cached `cueRanks` at each K threshold.
- **Incomplete Ranking Pool** — Stage 2 ranking only compared triggers against fillers + the target cue (21 entries), excluding the other 9 cues as distractors. Now ranks against the full 29-entry pool (20 fillers + 9 other cues) for accurate difficulty measurement.
- **Dead Import** — Removed unused `sessionSearchMemoryHandler` import from locomo-plus.ts.
- **Hardcoded Metric** — Replaced `String(2).padStart(5)` with dynamic `principlesStored` counter in metrics box.

## [7.8.6] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- **Batch Embeddings Dead Code** — The factory's composed provider object never wired `generateEmbeddings()` from the embed adapter, making the entire Voyage batch embedding path unreachable. The backfill handler always fell back to sequential single-text calls. Now correctly passes the method through when the adapter supports it.
- **Backfill Error Resilience** — If the Voyage API batch call succeeded but a single `patchLedger()` DB write failed, the entire batch was marked as failed and all paid embeddings were discarded. Now each entry is persisted independently with its own error handling.

## [7.8.4] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- **JSON-RPC Stream Integrity** — Replaced `console.info()` calls in `factory.ts` with `console.error()`. In Node.js, `console.info()` writes to stdout (same as `console.log()`), which corrupted the MCP JSON-RPC stream and caused dashboard connectivity failures and auto-load timeouts.
- **Misleading Provider Log** — Fixed a log message that incorrectly reported "routing embeddings to GeminiAdapter" when Voyage AI was actually auto-detected via `VOYAGE_API_KEY`. The anthropic info message now only fires when Gemini is genuinely selected as the fallback.
- **CLI Tool Logging** — Reverted `console.log` → `console.error` changes in `cliHandler.ts` and `universalImporter.ts` that were incorrectly applied in a previous fix. These are standalone CLI tools (not imported by the MCP server) and require `stdout` for programmatic output (e.g., `prism verify status --json | jq`).
- **Sandbox Template Consistency** — Reverted QuickJS sandbox code templates (`codeMode.ts`) back to `console.log()` to match the tool descriptions in `definitions.ts` that instruct LLMs to use `console.log()`.
- **Voyage Adapter Docs** — Updated stale header comments that still referenced `voyage-3` as the default model (now `voyage-code-3` since v7.8.3).

## [7.8.3] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- **Voyage API MRL Dimension Truncation** — Fixed an integration crash where Voyage AI's `voyage-code-3` model rejected explicit dimension requests off the native binary boundaries in API requests. Implemented mathematically-sound client-side Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) truncation to safely slice native 1024-dim vectors down to the strict 768-dim schema constraint required by sqlite-vec and pgvector.
- **Default Embedding Routing** — Upgraded the default Voyage model from `voyage-3` to `voyage-code-3` strictly mapped for superior workspace/technical codebase performance.
- **Environment Auto-Detection** — Augmented `auto` embedding router to seamlessly shift priority to Voyage AI automatically when `VOYAGE_API_KEY` is detected in the environment.

## [7.8.2] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed
- **Docker / CI Build Failures** — Fixed an overly broad `.gitignore` rule that caused `src/memory/spreadingActivation.ts` to be excluded from version control, resulting in `TS2307` compiler errors during clean builds (like on Glama or Smithery).

## [7.8.0] - 2026-04-04 — Cognitive Architecture

> **The biggest leap forward yet.** Prism moves beyond flat vector search into a true cognitive architecture inspired by human brain mechanics. Your agents don't just remember; they learn.

### Added
- **Episodic → Semantic Consolidation (Hebbian Learning)** — Compaction no longer blindly summarizes text. Prism now extracts *principles* from raw event logs and writes them to a dedicated `semantic_knowledge` table with `confidence` scores that increase every time a pattern is observed. True Hebbian learning: neurons that fire together wire together.
- **Multi-Hop Causal Reasoning** — Compaction extracts causal links (`caused_by`, `led_to`) and persists them as `memory_links` graph edges. At retrieval time, ACT-R spreading activation propagates through these edges with damped fan effect (`1 / ln(fan + e)`), lateral inhibition, and configurable hop depth. Your agent follows trains of thought, not just keyword matches.
- **Uncertainty-Aware Rejection Gate** — Dual-signal safety layer (similarity floor + gap distance) that tells the LLM "I searched my memory, and I confidently do not know the answer" instead of feeding it garbage context. Agents that know their own boundaries don't hallucinate.
- **Dynamic Fast Weight Decay** — Semantic rollup nodes (`is_rollup`) decay 50% slower than episodic entries (`ageModifier = 0.5`), creating Long-Term Context anchors. The agent forgets raw chatter but permanently remembers core personality, project rules, and architectural decisions.
- **LoCoMo Benchmark Harness** — New standalone integration suite (`tests/benchmarks/locomo.ts`) deterministically benchmarks Long-Context Memory retrieval against multi-hop compaction structures via local `MockLLM` frameworks.

### Fixed
- **Schema Alignment (P0)** — Corrected `semantic_knowledge` DDL to match DML: renamed `rule` → `description`, added `instances`, `related_entities`, and `updated_at` columns. Added migration stubs.
- **Search SQL (P1)** — Updated Tier-1 (sqlite-vec) and Tier-2 (TurboQuant) search queries to include `is_rollup`, `importance`, and `last_accessed_at` for ACT-R decay consumption.
- **userId Threading (P2)** — Threaded `userId` through the entire `upsertSemanticKnowledge` stack (Interface → SQLite → Supabase Stub → Compaction Handler) to satisfy `NOT NULL` constraints.
- **Spreading Activation Performance (P1)** — Eliminated N+1 SQL round-trips by deriving fan-out counts locally from edge results. Added `LIMIT 200` to prevent memory pressure on high-degree nodes.
- **Keyword Rejection Gate Isolation** — Properly scoped uncertainty rejection strictly for vector-mapped threshold logic, bypassing FTS5 keyword (BM25) paths to prevent silent search failures.

## [7.7.1] - 2026-04-04

### Added
- **Smithery Registry Manifest** — Implemented an unauthenticated `/.well-known/mcp/server-card.json` endpoint to seamlessly expose MCP capabilities to cloud registries (like Smithery.ai) bypassing "chicken-and-egg" startup timeout blocks.
  - Manifest is hosted independently and ahead of the Dashboard Auth Gate to guarantee 100% public discovery while protecting active sessions.
  - Generates a static index via `getAllPossibleTools()` ensuring maximum visibility (exposing Hivemind and Dark Factory tools dynamically) without requiring local environment variable injection.
  - Includes extended boolean configuration schemas for `prismEnableHivemind`, `prismDarkFactoryEnabled`, and `prismTaskRouterEnabled` allowing instant configuration directly via Smithery UI.

## [7.7.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added
- **SSE Transport Mode** — Full native support for Server-Sent Events network connections (`SSEServerTransport`). Prism is now a cloud-ready, network-accessible MCP server capable of running on Render, Smithery, or any remote host.
  - Dynamically provisions unique `createServer()` instances per connection mapping them via a persistent `activeSSETransports` register.
  - Exposes `GET /sse` for stream initialization and `POST /messages` for JSON-RPC message delivery.
  - Strictly inherits Dashboard UI credentials via shared HTTP auth. Unauthenticated connections elegantly decline with `401 Unauthorized` JSON.

### Security
- **Auth Guard Integrity** — Enhanced the basic HTTP auth gate to explicitly catch MCP SSE endpoints alongside `/api/` returning clean JSON errors. Eliminates parsing crashes in remote MCP clients where unexpected HTML documents cause breaks.
- **Fail-Closed Network Guarding** — Wrapped SSE initialization handshake in `try/catch` and cleanup block. Protects the main NodeJS server loop against unhandled promise rejections triggering crashes on flaky client network connections.
- **Cors Hardening** — Pre-flight `OPTIONS` calls for `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` now comprehensively include `Authorization` allowing browsers to relay Dashboard Credentials seamlessly.

## [7.6.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added
- **Voyage AI Embedding Provider** — Introduced native `VoyageAdapter` as a pluggable embedding provider alongside OpenAI and Gemini. 
  - Allows semantic vector embedding using Voyage AI models inside the Mind Palace architecture.
  - Exposes config via `VOYAGE_API_KEY` mapped directly into the LLM adapter factory.
  - Added dedicated unit tests guaranteeing semantic fidelity.

## [7.5.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added
- **Intent Health Dashboard** — Per-project 0–100 health scoring in the Mind Palace, powered by a 3-signal algorithm: staleness decay (50pts, linear over `intent_health_stale_threshold_days`), TODO overload (30pts, tiered at 4/7+ thresholds), and decision presence (20pts). Renders as a gauge card with actionable signals per project.
- **`intent_health_stale_threshold_days` System Setting** — Configurable via Dashboard UI (default: 30 days). Controls when a project is considered fully stale.
- **14 Intent Health Tests** — Exhaustive coverage: fresh/stale/empty contexts, NaN timestamps, NaN thresholds, custom thresholds, TODO boundaries, multi-session decisions, score ceiling, signal severity matrix, clock skew, and signal shape validation.

### Changed
- **`computeIntentHealth` NaN Guard** — Extended `staleThresholdDays <= 0` guard to `!Number.isFinite(staleThresholdDays) || staleThresholdDays <= 0`. Catches `NaN`, `Infinity`, and negative values (previously `NaN <= 0` evaluated to `false` in JS, bypassing the guard).
- **Defensive Score Clamp** — `Math.min(100, Math.round(...))` ceiling on total score prevents future regressions from exceeding the 0–100 gauge range.

### Fixed
- **10 XSS Injection Vectors Patched** — Comprehensive `escapeHtml()` sweep across all dashboard innerHTML paths:
  - Pipeline `objective` (stored user input via `session_start_pipeline`)
  - Pipeline `project` name in factory tab
  - Pipeline `current_step` name in factory tab
  - Pipeline `error` message in factory tab
  - Factory catch handler `err.message`
  - Ledger `decisions` array members (`.join(', ')` → `.map(escapeHtml).join(', ')`)
  - Project `<option>` text in selector dropdowns
  - History timeline `h.version` badge
  - Health card `data.score` (typeof number guard)
  - CSS selector injection in `fetchNextHealth` (querySelector → safe array iteration)
- **Division-by-zero** — `staleThresholdDays=0` no longer produces `Infinity` score cascade.

## [7.4.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- **Adversarial Evaluation Framework** — `PLAN_CONTRACT` and `EVALUATE` steps added to the Dark Factory pipeline, implementing a native generator/evaluator sprint architecture with isolated contexts and pre-committed scoring contracts.
  - `PLAN_CONTRACT` — Before any code changes, generator and evaluator agree on a machine-parseable rubric (`ContractPayload`: criteria with `id` + `description` fields). Contract is written to `contract_rubric.json` in the working directory.
  - `EVALUATE` — After `EXECUTE`, an isolated adversarial evaluator scores the output against the contract. Structured findings include `severity`, `criterion_id`, `pass_fail`, and evidence pointers (`file`, `line`, `description`).
  - Pipeline state machine: `PLAN → PLAN_CONTRACT → EXECUTE → EVALUATE → VERIFY → FINALIZE`
- **`DEFAULT_MAX_REVISIONS` constant** — Replaces magic number `3` across `schema.ts` and `safetyController.ts`. Configurable via `spec.maxRevisions`.
- **78 new adversarial unit tests** (`tests/darkfactory/adversarial-eval.test.ts`) covering all parser branches, transition logic, deadlock/oscillation scenarios, conservative-default behavior, and context-bleed guards.

### Changed
- **`EvaluationPayload.findings[].evidence.line`** — Type corrected from `string` to `number` (1-indexed line number). `EVALUATE_SCHEMA` LLM prompt updated to match.
- **`PipelineState.contract_payload`** — Type narrowed from `any` to `PipelineContractPayload | null` for end-to-end type safety.
- **`evalPlanViable` conservative default** — When `EVALUATE` step output cannot be parsed (malformed LLM response), `planViable` now defaults to `false` (escalate to PLAN re-plan) instead of `true` (burn EXECUTE revisions). Prevents looping on systematically broken LLM output.
- **EVALUATE notes persisted** — `result.notes` from the `EVALUATE` step is now forwarded to `pipeline.notes` alongside `EXECUTE` notes. Previously, evaluator findings were discarded from the persistent pipeline record.
- **Generator Feedback Loop** — The Evaluator's critique (`EvaluationPayload.findings`) is now correctly serialized and injected directly into the `EXECUTE` prompt during revision loops (`eval_revisions > 0`). The Generator is no longer blind to why it failed — it receives the full line-by-line evidence (criterion, severity, file, line) from the previous evaluation.
- **TurboQuant warm-up** — Moved to `setImmediate` in `server.ts` to prevent event loop blocking during the MCP stdio handshake.

### Fixed
- **`parseContractOutput` per-criterion validation** — Each criterion element is now validated to have string `id` and `description` fields. Primitive elements (e.g. `[42, "bad"]`) are rejected with a position-keyed error message.
- **`parseEvaluationOutput` findings array guard** — `findings` field is now validated to be an array when present. Non-array values (e.g. `"findings": "none"`) are rejected at the parser boundary.
- **Strict Evidence Validation** — `parseEvaluationOutput` now enforces deep element-level validation on the `findings` array. Evaluator findings with `pass_fail: false` that are missing an `evidence` object (file and line pointers) are strictly rejected. Prevents LLM hallucination of unsupported severity claims with no evidence anchor.
- **`contract_rubric.json` write isolation** — `fs.writeFileSync` is now wrapped in try/catch. Disk/permission errors immediately mark the pipeline `FAILED` instead of leaving it stuck in `RUNNING` indefinitely.
- **Dead `STEP_ORDER` array removed** — Unused constant in `safetyController.ts` replaced by the authoritative `switch` statement.
- **`'evaluation_result' as any`** — Invalid event type replaced with the correct `'learning'` literal for the experience ledger call.
- **SQLite backfill migration** — `ALTER TABLE DEFAULT` only applies to new inserts; existing rows now explicitly have `eval_revisions = 0` set via a `WHERE eval_revisions IS NULL` backfill `UPDATE`.
- **Supabase `listPipelines` parity** — `contract_payload` was missing JSON deserialization in `listPipelines`. Fixed to match the behavior of `getPipeline`.

### Storage Schema (v7.4.0 migration)
- New columns on `dark_factory_pipelines`: `eval_revisions INTEGER DEFAULT 0`, `contract_payload TEXT`, `notes TEXT`
- Supabase: same columns via `prism_apply_ddl` RPC
- SQLite backfill: `UPDATE ... SET eval_revisions = 0 WHERE eval_revisions IS NULL`

### Engineering
- 978 tests across 44 suites (78 new adversarial evaluation tests), all passing, zero regressions
- TypeScript: clean, zero errors
- 10 files changed, +1027 / -73

## [7.0.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **ACT-R Activation Memory** — Scientifically-grounded memory retrieval based on Anderson's ACT-R cognitive architecture. Base-level activation `B_i = ln(Σ t_j^{-d})` replaces flat similarity search with recency × frequency scoring that mirrors human cognitive decay. Memories accessed recently and frequently surface first; stale context fades naturally.
- **Candidate-Scoped Spreading Activation** — Activation spreads only within the current search result set, preventing "God node" centrality bias where highly-connected nodes dominate every query regardless of relevance.
- **Composite Scoring** — `0.7 × similarity + 0.3 × σ(activation)` blends semantic relevance with cognitive activation. Sigmoid normalization keeps activation in `[0,1]` regardless of access pattern. Weights configurable via `PRISM_ACTR_WEIGHT_SIMILARITY` / `PRISM_ACTR_WEIGHT_ACTIVATION`.
- **Verification Operator Contract & JSON Modes** — `verify status` and `verify generate` now fully support `--json` output modes providing strict schema adherence (`schema_version: 1`). Integrations guarantees deterministic exit codes (`0` for passing/warning/bypassed, `1` for blocked drift).
- **AccessLogBuffer** — In-memory batch-write buffer with 5-second flush window resolves `SQLITE_BUSY` contention during parallel multi-agent tool calls. Registered with `BackgroundTaskRegistry` for graceful shutdown — no orphaned writes on `SIGTERM`.
- **Zero Cold-Start** — Memory creation now seeds an initial access log entry. New memories are immediately rankable without a warm-up period.
- **Supabase Migration 037** — `actr_access_log` table + RPC functions for access log writes and activation computation. Full feature parity with SQLite backend.
- **5 New Environment Variables** — `PRISM_ACTR_ENABLED` (default: `true`), `PRISM_ACTR_DECAY` (default: `0.5`), `PRISM_ACTR_WEIGHT_SIMILARITY` (default: `0.7`), `PRISM_ACTR_WEIGHT_ACTIVATION` (default: `0.3`), `PRISM_ACTR_ACCESS_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS` (default: `90`).

### Changed
- **Cognitive Memory Pipeline** — `cognitiveMemory.ts` refactored to integrate ACT-R activation scoring into the retrieval pipeline. When `PRISM_ACTR_ENABLED=true`, search results are re-ranked with composite scores; when disabled, falls back to pure similarity.
- **Tracing Integration** — OpenTelemetry spans added for ACT-R activation computation, access log writes, and buffer flushes.

### Documentation
- **README Overhaul** — Added "Mind Palace" terminology definition, promoted Universal Import to top-level section, added Quick Start port-conflict collapsible, added "Recommended Minimal Setup" TL;DR for environment variables, updated dashboard screenshot to v7.0.0, added dashboard-runs-in-background reassurance.
- **ROADMAP** — v7.0.0 entry with full ACT-R feature table. "State of Prism" updated to v7.0.0. Future tracks bumped to v8.x/v9+.

### Architecture
- New file: `src/utils/actrActivation.ts` — 250 lines. ACT-R base-level activation, sigmoid normalization, composite scoring.
- New file: `src/utils/accessLogBuffer.ts` — 199 lines. In-memory batch-write buffer with 5s flush, `BackgroundTaskRegistry` integration.
- New migration: `supabase/migrations/037_actr_access_log_parity.sql` — 121 lines. Access log table, RPC functions, retention cleanup.
- Extended: `src/storage/sqlite.ts` — Access log table creation, write/query methods, retention sweep.

## [6.5.3] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **Dashboard Auth Test Suite** — 42 new tests (`tests/dashboard/auth.test.ts`) covering the entire auth system: `safeCompare` timing-safety, `generateToken` entropy, `isAuthenticated` cookie/Basic Auth flows, `createRateLimiter` sliding window, and full HTTP integration tests for login, logout, auth gate, rate limiting, and CORS.
- **Rate Limiting** — `POST /api/auth/login` is now protected by a sliding-window rate limiter (5 attempts per 60 seconds per IP). Resets on successful login. Stale entries are auto-pruned to prevent memory leaks.
- **Logout Endpoint** — `POST /api/auth/logout` invalidates the session token server-side (deletes from `activeSessions` map) and clears the client cookie via `Max-Age=0`.
- **Auth Utilities Module** — Extracted `safeCompare`, `generateToken`, `isAuthenticated`, and `createRateLimiter` from `server.ts` closures into `src/dashboard/authUtils.ts` for testability and reuse.

### Security
- **CORS Hardening** — When `AUTH_ENABLED`, `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is now set dynamically to the request's `Origin` header (not wildcard `*`), and `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` is sent. Wildcard `*` is only used when auth is disabled.
- **Cryptographic Token Generation** — `generateToken()` now uses `crypto.randomBytes(32).toString("hex")` instead of `Math.random()` for session tokens.
- **Colon-Safe Password Parsing** — Basic Auth credential extraction now uses `indexOf(":")` instead of `split(":")` to correctly handle passwords containing colon characters.

### Engineering
- 42 new auth tests (unit + HTTP integration), zero regressions in existing 14 dashboard API tests
- New file: `src/dashboard/authUtils.ts` — extracted pure functions with injectable `AuthConfig`
- New file: `tests/dashboard/auth.test.ts` — 5 describe blocks, 42 test cases

## [6.5.2] - 2026-04-01

### Engineering
- **SDM/HDC Edge-Case Test Hardening** — 37 new tests (571 → 608 total) covering critical boundary conditions across the cognitive routing pipeline:
  - **HDC Engine** — Bind length mismatch rejection, empty bundle handling, single-vector identity, XOR self-inverse property, permute empty/single-word edge cases, density preservation invariant.
  - **PolicyGateway** — All 4 constructor rejection paths, exact-at-threshold boundary routing (0.85 → CLARIFY, 0.95 → AUTO_ROUTE), null-concept override behavior.
  - **StateMachine** — Constructor/transition dimension guards, defensive cloning, `injectStateForTesting` guard, initial-state immutability.
  - **SDM Engine** — Hamming identity/complement properties, reverse mode cross-talk isolation, write/read dimension guards, k=0 boundary, `importState` guard, `exportState` → `importState` lossless roundtrip.

---

## [6.5.1] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed
- **Dashboard Project Selector Bootstrap Failure** — Resolved a startup failure where `/api/projects` returned errors and the selector remained stuck on "Loading projects..." when `SUPABASE_URL`/`SUPABASE_KEY` were unresolved template placeholders (e.g. `${SUPABASE_URL}`).
- **Storage Backend Fallback Safety** — Added runtime guardrails to automatically fall back to local SQLite storage when Supabase is requested but env configuration is invalid/unresolved, preventing dashboard hard-failure in mixed/local setups.

### Changed
- **Config Sanitization** — Added Supabase env sanitization and URL validation to ignore unresolved placeholder strings and invalid non-http(s) values.

### Release Process
- Delivered as a **single pull request** post-publish hardening pass to keep code + docs + release notes aligned in one review artifact.

---

## [6.5.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **HDC Cognitive Routing** — New `session_cognitive_route` MCP tool composes an agent's current state, role, and action into a single 768-dim binary hypervector via XOR binding, resolves it to a semantic concept via Hamming distance, and routes through a three-outcome policy gateway (`direct` / `clarify` / `fallback`). Powered by `ConceptDictionary`, `HdcStateMachine`, and `PolicyGateway` in `src/sdm/`.
- **Per-Project Threshold Overrides** — Fallback and clarify thresholds are configurable per-project via tool arguments and persisted via `getSetting()`/`setSetting()`. **Phase 2 storage-parity scope note:** No new storage migrations are required — the existing `prism_settings` key-value table already abstracts SQLite/Supabase parity. Threshold values are stored as decimal strings (e.g., `"0.45"`) and parsed back to `Number` on read.
- **Explainability Mode** — When `explain: true`, responses include `convergence_steps`, raw `distance`, and `ambiguity` flag. Controlled by `PRISM_HDC_EXPLAINABILITY_ENABLED` (default: `true`).
- **Cognitive Observability** — `recordCognitiveRoute()` in `graphMetrics.ts` tracks 14 cognitive metrics: total routes, route distribution (direct/clarify/fallback), rolling confidence/distance averages, ambiguity count, null-concept count, and last-route timestamp. Warning heuristics fire when `fallback_rate > 30%` or `ambiguous_resolution_rate > 40%`.
- **Dashboard Cognitive Card** — Route distribution bar, confidence/distance gauges, and warning badges in the Mind Palace metrics panel (ES5-safe). On-demand "Cognitive Route" button in the Node Editor panel.
- **Dashboard API Endpoint** — `GET /api/graph/cognitive-route` in `graphRouter.ts` exposes the handler for dashboard consumption with query parameter parsing (project, state, role, action, thresholds, explain).

### Architecture
- New tool: `session_cognitive_route` — `src/tools/graphHandlers.ts` (`sessionCognitiveRouteHandler`)
- New API route: `GET /api/graph/cognitive-route` — `src/dashboard/graphRouter.ts`
- Extended: `src/observability/graphMetrics.ts` — `CognitiveMetrics` interface, `recordCognitiveRoute()`, cognitive warning heuristics
- Extended: `src/dashboard/ui.ts` — Cognitive metrics card, cognitive route button (ES5-safe)
- Config: `PRISM_HDC_ENABLED` (default: `true`), `PRISM_HDC_EXPLAINABILITY_ENABLED` (default: `true`)

### Fixed
- **Dashboard `triggerTestMe` Regression** — Restored `async function triggerTestMe()` declaration that was stripped during v6.5 code insertion. Removed duplicate `cognitiveRouteBtn` DOM block (duplicate IDs). Restored `testMeContainer` div in panel flow.

### Engineering
- 566 tests across 30 suites (all passing, zero regressions)
- 42 new tests: 26 handler integration tests (`tests/tools/cognitiveRoute.test.ts`) + 16 dashboard API tests (`tests/dashboard/cognitiveRoute.test.ts`)
- TypeScript strict mode: zero errors

---


## [6.2.1] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed
- **Dashboard ES5 Compatibility** — Refactored all inline `<script>` code in the Mind Palace dashboard to strict ES5 syntax. Replaced `const`/`let`, arrow functions, optional chaining (`?.`), and template literals with ES5 equivalents (`var`, `function` expressions, manual null checks, string concatenation). Fixes `SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier 'block'` that prevented the dashboard from initializing in certain browser environments.
- **Compatibility Rule Enforcement** — Added a mandatory ES5-only compatibility comment block at the top of the inline `<script>` tag to prevent future regressions.

### Engineering
- 510 tests across 28 suites (all passing)
- TypeScript strict mode: zero errors

---

## [6.2.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Edge Synthesis ("The Dream Procedure")** — Automated background linker (`session_synthesize_edges`) discovers semantically similar but disconnected memory nodes via cosine similarity (threshold ≥ 0.7). Batch-limited to 50 sources × 3 neighbors per sweep to prevent runaway graph growth.
- **Graph Pruning (Soft-Prune)** — Configurable strength-based pruning (`PRISM_GRAPH_PRUNING_ENABLED`) soft-deletes weak links below a configurable minimum strength. Includes per-project cooldown, backpressure guards, and sweep budget controls.
- **SLO Observability Layer** — `graphMetrics.ts` module tracks synthesis success rate, net new links, prune ratio, and sweep duration. Exposes `slo` and `warnings` fields for proactive health monitoring.
- **Dashboard Metrics Integration** — New SLO cards, warning badges, and pruning skip breakdown (backpressure / cooldown / budget) in the Mind Palace dashboard at `/api/graph/metrics`.
- **Temporal Decay Heatmaps** — UI overlay toggle where un-accessed nodes desaturate while Graduated nodes stay vibrant. Graph router extraction + decay view toggle.
- **Active Recall Prompt Generation** — "Test Me" utility in the node editor panel generates synthetic quizzes from semantic neighbors for knowledge activation.
- **Supabase Weak-Link RPC (WS4.1)** — New `prism_summarize_weak_links` Postgres function (migration 036) aggregates pruning server-side in one RPC call, eliminating N+1 network roundtrips. TypeScript fast-path with automatic fallback.
- **Migration 035** — Tenant-safe graph writes + soft-delete hardening for MemoryLinks.

### Fixed
- **Scheduler `projects_processed` Semantics** — Now tracks all attempted projects, not just successes, for accurate SLO derivation.
- **Router Integration Test** — Added `GET /api/graph/metrics` integration test to validate the full metrics pipeline.
- **Export Test Mock Staleness** — Added missing `PRISM_GRAPH_PRUNE*` config exports to `sessionExportMemory.test.ts` mock (transitive import fix).
- **Dashboard `const` in Switch** — Fixed `const` declaration in switch-case scope (`pruneSkipParts`) that caused strict-mode errors in some browsers.

### Architecture
- New module: `src/observability/graphMetrics.ts` — in-memory metrics with SLO derivation and warning heuristics.
- New migration: `supabase/migrations/036_prune_summary_rpc.sql` — server-side aggregate RPC.
- Extended: `src/backgroundScheduler.ts` — synthesis telemetry, pruning telemetry, sweep duration recording.
- Extended: `src/dashboard/graphRouter.ts` — `GET /api/graph/metrics` endpoint.
- Extended: `src/dashboard/ui.ts` — SLO cards, warning badges, pruning breakdown.

### Engineering
- 510 tests across 28 suites (all passing)
- TypeScript strict mode: zero errors

---

## [6.1.9] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Tavily Support** — Added `@tavily/core` integration as a robust alternative to Brave + Firecrawl for the Web Scholar pipeline. Supports `performTavilySearch` and `performTavilyExtract`.

### Fixed
- **Tavily Chunking & Error Handling** — Implemented URL array chunking (batches of 20 URLs) for `performTavilyExtract` to bypass API limits and prevent data loss.
- **Upstream Network Resilience** — `performTavilySearch` is wrapped in a `try...catch` block to cleanly return empty arrays on API failure/timeout, avoiding unhandled promise rejections.

---

## [6.1.8] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed
- **Missing Type Guard** — Added `isSessionCompactLedgerArgs` for `SESSION_COMPACT_LEDGER_TOOL`. The tool existed with no corresponding guard; an LLM hallucinating `{threshold: "many"}` would reach the handler unchecked.
- **Array Field Validation** — `isSessionSaveLedgerArgs` now validates `todos`, `files_changed`, and `decisions` with `Array.isArray`, preventing string coercion into array-typed fields.
- **Enum Literal Guard** — `isSessionExportMemoryArgs` now rejects `format` values outside the literal union `'json' | 'markdown' | 'vault'` at the MCP boundary.
- **Numeric Guards** — `isSessionIntuitiveRecallArgs` now validates `limit` and `threshold` as `typeof number`, blocking `{limit: "many"}` style coercion.
- **Legacy Guard Migration** — `isMemoryHistoryArgs`, `isMemoryCheckoutArgs`, `isSessionSaveImageArgs` migrated to the uniform `Record<string, unknown>` pattern. `isMemoryHistoryArgs` also gains a missing `limit` number check.

---

## [6.1.7] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed
- **Toggle Persistence** — `saveSetting()` now returns `Promise<boolean>` and UI toggles (Hivemind, Auto-Capture) roll back their optimistic state on server failure.
- **Cache-Busting** — `loadSettings()` appends `?t=<timestamp>` to bypass stale browser/service-worker caches.
- **HTTP Error Propagation** — Explicit 4xx/5xx detection in `saveSetting()` surfaces toast notifications to the user on failed saves.

---

## [6.1.6] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed
- **Type Guard Hardening (Round 1)** — Audited and refactored 11 MCP tool argument type guards to include explicit `typeof` validation for all optional fields. Prevents LLM-hallucinated payloads from causing runtime type coercion errors in handlers.

---

## [6.1.5] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- **`maintenance_vacuum` Tool** — New MCP tool to run `VACUUM` on the local SQLite database after large purge operations, reclaiming page allocations that SQLite retains until explicitly vacuumed.

### Fixed
- **Prototype Pollution Guards** — CRDT merge pipeline hardened against `__proto__` / `constructor` injection via `Object.create(null)` scratchpads.

### Tests
- **425-test Edge-Case Suite** — Added comprehensive tests across 20 files covering CRDT merges, TurboQuant mathematical invariants, prototype pollution guards, and SQLite retention TTL boundary conditions.

---

## [6.1.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- **Smart Memory Merge UI (Knowledge Gardening)**: Integrated a dynamic dropdown directly into the graph's `nodeEditorPanel`. Users can now instantly merge duplicate or fragmented keywords directly from the UI without backend refactoring.
- **Deep Purge Visualization (Memory Density)**: Added an intuitive "Memory Density" analytical stat within the `schedulerCard`. This zero-overhead metric visualizes the ratio of standard insights versus highly-reinforced (Graduated) ideas, rendering immediate feedback on the project's learning efficiency.
- **Semantic Search Highlighting**: Re-engineered the payload rendering for vector results to utilize a RegEx-powered match engine. Found context fragments dynamically wrap exact keyword matches in a vibrant `<mark>` tag, instantly explaining *why* a vector was pulled.

---

## [6.0.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added
- **Context-Boosted Vector Search**: Intelligent API param `context_boost` biases semantic queries by organically injecting current handoff state/working context into the embedding model alongside user queries.
- **AbortController Concurrency Safety**: Hardened the UI `performSearch` loop to elegantly cancel in-flight API requests during rapid debounce typing.

---

## [5.4.0] - 2026-03-28
- **CRDT Handoff Merging**: Replaced strict OCC rejection with automatic conflict-free multi-agent state merging. When two agents save concurrently, Prism now auto-merges instead of rejecting.
  - Custom OR-Map engine (`crdtMerge.ts`): Add-Wins OR-Set for arrays (`open_todos`), Last-Writer-Wins for scalars (`last_summary`, `key_context`).
  - 3-way merge with `getHandoffAtVersion()` base retrieval from SQLite and Supabase.
  - `disable_merge` bypass parameter for strict OCC when needed.
  - `totalCrdtMerges` tracked in health stats and dashboard.
- **Background Purge Scheduler**: Unified automated maintenance system that replaces all manual storage management.
  - Single `setInterval` loop (default: 12 hours, configurable via `PRISM_SCHEDULER_INTERVAL_MS`).
  - 4 maintenance tasks: TTL sweep, Ebbinghaus importance decay, auto-compaction, deep storage purge.
  - Dashboard status card with last sweep timestamp, duration, and per-task results.
  - `PRISM_SCHEDULER_ENABLED` env var (default: `true`).
- **Autonomous Web Scholar**: Agent-driven background research pipeline.
  - Brave Search → Firecrawl scrape → LLM synthesis → Prism ledger injection.
  - Task-aware topic selection: biases research toward active Hivemind agent tasks.
  - Reentrancy guard prevents concurrent pipeline runs.
  - 15K character content cap per scraped article for cost control.
  - Configurable: `PRISM_SCHOLAR_ENABLED`, `PRISM_SCHOLAR_INTERVAL_MS`, `PRISM_SCHOLAR_TOPICS`, `PRISM_SCHOLAR_MAX_ARTICLES_PER_RUN`.
- **Scholar ↔ Hivemind Integration**: Scholar registers as `scholar` role agent with lifecycle heartbeats at each pipeline stage. Telepathy broadcast fires on completion to notify active agents. Task-aware topic selection biases research toward topics matching active agent tasks.
- **Updated Architecture Documentation**: 3 new sections in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` covering Agent Hivemind, Background Scheduler, and Web Scholar with mermaid diagrams.

### Architecture
- New module: `src/scholar/webScholar.ts` — 281 lines, full pipeline with Hivemind integration.
- New module: `src/crdtMerge.ts` — OR-Map engine with 3-way merge algorithm.
- Extended: `src/backgroundScheduler.ts` — unified maintenance + Scholar scheduling.
- Storage interface: `getHandoffAtVersion()` for CRDT base retrieval.

### Engineering
- 362 tests across 16 suites (10 new Scholar tests)
- Clean TypeScript build, zero errors
- Backward compatible: all new features are opt-in via env vars

---

## [5.3.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- **Hivemind Health Watchdog**: Server-side active monitoring system for multi-agent coordination. Transforms the Hivemind from a passive registry into a self-healing orchestrator.
  - **State Machine**: Agents transition through `ACTIVE → STALE (5m) → FROZEN (15m) → OFFLINE (30m, auto-pruned)` based on heartbeat freshness.
  - **OVERDUE Detection**: Agents can declare `expected_duration_minutes` on heartbeat. If the task exceeds this ETA, the Watchdog flags the agent as OVERDUE.
  - **Loop Detection**: DJB2 hash of `current_task` is computed on every heartbeat. If the same task repeats ≥5 times consecutively, the agent is flagged as LOOPING. Detection runs inline in the heartbeat hot path (~0.01ms overhead).
  - **Telepathy (Alert Injection)**: Watchdog alerts are appended **directly to `result.content[]`** of tool responses, bypassing MCP's `sendLoggingMessage` limitation where LLMs don't read debug logs. This guarantees the LLM reads the alert in its reasoning loop.
  - **Configurable Thresholds**: All thresholds configurable via env vars (`PRISM_WATCHDOG_INTERVAL_MS`, `PRISM_WATCHDOG_STALE_MIN`, `PRISM_WATCHDOG_FROZEN_MIN`, `PRISM_WATCHDOG_OFFLINE_MIN`, `PRISM_WATCHDOG_LOOP_THRESHOLD`).
- **`expected_duration_minutes` parameter**: New optional parameter on `agent_heartbeat` tool for task ETA declarations.
- **Health-State Dashboard**: Hivemind Radar now shows color-coded health indicators (🟢/🟡/🔴/⏰/🔄), loop count badges, and auto-refreshes every 15 seconds.
- **`getAllAgents()` / `updateAgentStatus()`**: New storage backend methods for cross-project agent sweeps and whitelist-guarded status transitions.
- **Supabase Migration 032**: `task_start_time`, `expected_duration_minutes`, `task_hash`, `loop_count` columns + user_id index.

### Architecture
- New module: `src/hivemindWatchdog.ts` — 270 lines of pure business logic, zero MCP Server dependency, fully testable in isolation.
- Alert queue: In-memory `Map<string, WatchdogAlert>` with dedup key `project:role:status` — fire-and-forget, no persistence needed.
- Dual-mode alerting: Direct content injection (primary, for LLMs) + `sendLoggingMessage` (secondary, for operators).
- Graceful degradation: All sweep errors are caught and logged, never crash the server. `PRISM_ENABLE_HIVEMIND` gate prevents any CPU overhead for single-agent users.

### Engineering
- 10 files changed, ~600 lines added
- Clean TypeScript build, zero errors
- Backward compatible: all new columns have defaults, watchdog is no-op without `PRISM_ENABLE_HIVEMIND=true`

---

## [5.2.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **Cognitive Memory — Ebbinghaus Importance Decay**: Entries now have `last_accessed_at` tracking. At retrieval time, `effective_importance = base × 0.95^days` computes a time-decayed relevance score. Frequently accessed memories stay prominent; neglected ones fade naturally.
- **Context-Weighted Retrieval** (`context_boost` parameter): When enabled on `session_search_memory`, the active project's branch, keywords, and context are prepended to the search query before embedding generation — naturally biasing the vector toward contextually relevant results.
- **Smart Consolidation**: Enhanced the `session_compact_ledger` prompt to extract recurring principles and patterns alongside summaries, producing richer rollup entries.
- **Universal History Migration**: Modular migration utility using the Strategy Pattern. Ingest historical sessions from Claude Code (JSONL streaming), Gemini (OOM-safe StreamArray), and OpenAI/ChatGPT (JSON) into the Mind Palace.
  - **Conversation Grouping**: Turns are grouped into logical conversations using a 30-minute time-gap heuristic. A 100MB file with 200 conversations → 200 summary entries (not 50,000 raw turns).
  - **Idempotent Deduplication**: Each conversation gets a deterministic ID. Re-running the same import is a no-op.
  - **Dashboard Import UI**: File picker (📂 Browse) + manual path input, auto-format detection, real-time result display.
  - Features `p-limit(5)` concurrency control and `--dry-run` support.

### Security
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Added 17-column allowlist to `patchLedger()` in SQLite storage. Dynamic column interpolation now rejects any column not in the allowlist.

### Fixed
- **Supabase DDL v31**: Added missing `last_accessed_at` column migration for Supabase users. Without this, the Ebbinghaus decay logic would have thrown a column-not-found error.
- **context_boost guard**: Now logs a warning and continues gracefully when `context_boost=true` is passed without a `project` parameter, instead of silently failing.
- **Redundant getStorage() call**: Removed duplicate storage initialization in the Ebbinghaus decay block.
- **README dead link**: Fixed `#supabase-setup` anchor (inside `<details>` blocks, GitHub doesn't generate anchors).

### Engineering
- 9 new migration tests (adapter parsing, conversation grouping, dedup, tool keyword preservation)
- 352 tests across 15 suites
- 17 files changed, +1,016 lines

---

## [5.1.0] - 2026-03-27
### Added
- **Deep Storage Mode**: New `deep_storage_purge` tool to reclaim ~90% of vector storage by dropping float32 vectors for entries with TurboQuant compressed blobs.
- **Knowledge Graph Editor**: Transformed the Mind Palace Neural Graph into an interactive editor with dynamic filtering, node renaming, and surgical keyword deletion.
### Fixed
- **Auto-Load Reliability**: Hardened auto-load prompt instructions and added hook scripts for Claude Code / Antigravity to ensure memory is loaded on the first turn (bypassing model CoT hallucinations).
### Engineering
- 303/303 automated tests passing across 13 suites.

## 🚀 v5.0.0 — The TurboQuant Update (2026-03-26)

**Quantized Agentic Memory is here.**

### ✨ Features

- **10× Storage Reduction:** Integrated Google's TurboQuant algorithm (ICLR 2026) to compress 768-dim embeddings from 3,072 bytes to ~400 bytes. Zero external dependencies — pure TypeScript math core with Householder QR, Lloyd-Max scalar quantization, and QJL residual correction.
- **Two-Tier Search:** Introduced a JS-land asymmetric similarity search fallback (`asymmetricCosineSimilarity`), ensuring semantic search works even without native DB vector extensions (`sqlite-vec` / `pgvector`).
- **Atomic Backfill:** Optimized background workers to repair and compress embeddings in a single atomic database update (`patchLedger`), reducing lock contention for multi-agent Hivemind use cases.
- **Supabase Parity:** Full support for quantized blobs in the cloud backend (migration v29 + `saveLedger` insert).

### 🏗️ Architecture

- New file: `src/utils/turboquant.ts` — 665 lines, zero-dependency math core
- Storage schema: `embedding_compressed` (TEXT/base64), `embedding_format` (turbo3/turbo4/float32), `embedding_turbo_radius` (REAL)
- SQLite migration v5.0 (3 idempotent ALTER TABLE)
- Supabase migration v29 via `prism_apply_ddl` RPC

### 📊 Benchmarks

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
